============================================

## 1. Problem Formulation
**Our Dataset:** TMBD Movie Dataset .. on Kaggle
**Our Question:** What conditions are needed to create the ultimate movie of all time?

**Success definition:** Determined by the profit and popularity of the movie

**Rationale:** We believe that this dataset as well as the question we pose is very relevant to ............


## 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
a. Remove null/missing values within the dataset
b. Keep significant columns: 'budget', 'cast', 'director', 'genres', 'production_companies', 'release_year', 'release_date', 'runtime'
c. Spilt 'release_date' to form column for 'month'
d. 

## Basic Visualisation
a. Used box plots, histograms, violin plots in visualising numeric variables : 'budget', 'timeline', 'profit', 'popularity'
b. Used the GroupBy function to create a categorical bar plot of attribution against each categorical variable

## Explorator Data Analysis
a. Plot a linear regression line and correlation matrix for numerical dataset against variables of success
b. Explored bi-variate relationships with a scatter plot

## Machine Learning
*Random Forest Classifer*
*Logistic Regression*
*Neural Network*

# Conclusion of the analytical methods
*Machine Learning Comparisons*

# What we have learnt from this project
- interesting fact we found was that in order to create the ultimate movie of all time (based on our dataset), 
- how to justify the suitability of a model based on readings from classification report
- Logistic Regression model 
- Neural Network model
